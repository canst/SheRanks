# SheRanks
 SheRanks is a platform dedicated to promoting gender equality and safety for female students in universities. The project aims to create a safe and inclusive environment where all female students can thrive academically and personally. Through our tools and resources, we empower female students to voice their concerns, share experiences, and drive positive change.
